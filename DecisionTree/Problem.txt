I'm using grid search in sklearn to find best parameters of decision tree,

for example:
param_grid = {"criterion": ["gini", "entropy"],
              "min_samples_split": [2, 10, 20],
              "max_depth": [None, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100],
              "min_samples_leaf": [1, 5, 10],
              "max_leaf_nodes": [None, 5, 10, 20],
              }

1st Problem: 	To find the basic range of values for these parameters, so that gridsearch can loop through them to find the best parameter.
            	for eg: like should I use max_depth range to be like [10,20,40,60] etc or like [5,10,15,20,30] (similarly for other parameters)

2nd Problem: 	It takes awhile to run gridsearch.
            	But once the best parameters are determined. I only have to run the decision tree model once with those best parameters which will take less that 1min or sec(what is
the unit for time function).

3rd Problem: 	When trying to visualise the decision tree. I'm using export_graphviz library of sklearn. and it generates .dot file, which needs to be converted into pdf or png or
svg format to see a decision tree. Now, once converted to .dot format(for which code is run perfectly), the further conversion requires graphviz(a tool for graphs) but it is not supported for El Capitan.

            Basically we have to run following command on commandline:

            $dot -Tpng dotfile -o pngfile   (to convert to png)


Since I was not able to install graphviz, I used online converter for now to convert it into pdf. It resulted in file attached below.
Then I copy the text of pdf in another website(http://www.webgraphviz.com ) which converts it into svg format and displays the decision tree.

To summerize, I want to know starting basic values of those paramters and to make the process of making visuals of decision tree easier.
